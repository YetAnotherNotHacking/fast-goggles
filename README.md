# Fast Goggles
A utility for proffessional photographers to quickly find photos that best capture the event they are shooting, saving them time so that they are able to spend more of their time on high quality edits for their customers.

## Features:
    âš¡  Fast searching of files and generatoin of custom metadata
    ðŸ§  Makes use of machine learning libraries
    ðŸ§° Easy to integrate with AppleScript or you preffered method of automation
    ðŸ”§ CLI interface with Rich TUI for pleasant visual appearance

## Installation
From Source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YetAnotherNotHacking/fast-goggles.git
cd fast-goggles
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# If the above failes, you may want to try (at your own risk):
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
```
## Usage
First, navigate to the directory that the script is installed into. Then run:
```bash
python3 -m main --input <path> --ouput <path> --desired-emotion <happy,sad,angry,neutral,disgust,etc>
```
Run with --help to see all available options.

## How It Works
Fast Goggles uses basic machine learning to recognize the objects, poses, and emotions in relation to people in the image, it then compares that to the expected emptoin of the event, and based on the amount of a match identified, the score is given. The score may also be increased if certain objects are detected in the image e.g. a large number of people looking the correct direction.
